class Solution:
    """3629. Minimum Jumps to Reach End via Prime Teleportation

    You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

    You start at index 0, and your goal is to reach index `n - 1`.

    From any index `i`, you may perform one of the following operations:

    * **Adjacent Step**: Jump to index `i + 1` or `i - 1`, if the index is within
    bounds.

    * **Prime Teleportation**: If `nums[i]` is a prime number `p`, you may instantly
    jump to any index `j != i` such that `nums[j] % p == 0`.

    Return the **minimum** number of jumps required to reach index `n - 1`."""
