class Solution:
    """3660. Jump Game IX

    You are given an integer array `nums`.

    From any index `i`, you can jump to another index `j` under the following rules:

    * Jump to index `j` where `j > i` is allowed only if `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

    * Jump to index `j` where `j < i` is allowed only if `nums[j] > nums[i]`.

    For each index `i`, find the **maximum** **value** in `nums` that can be reached by
    following **any** sequence of valid jumps starting at `i`.

    Return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the **maximum** **value** reachable starting
    from index `i`."""

    def max_value(self, nums: list[int]) -> list[int]: ...

    maxValue = max_value
