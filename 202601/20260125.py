    You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the
    score of the `ith` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

    Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference**
    between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

    Return *the **minimum** possible difference*."""
