    """2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary

    You are given two string arrays, `queries` and `dictionary`. All words in each array
    comprise of lowercase English letters and have the same length.

    In one **edit** you can take a word from `queries`, and change any letter in it to
    any other letter. Find all words from `queries` that, after a **maximum** of two
    edits, equal some word from `dictionary`.

    Return *a list of all words from* `queries`*,* *that match with some word from*
    `dictionary` *after a maximum of **two edits***. Return the words in the **same
    order** they appear in `queries`."""
