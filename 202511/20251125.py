class Solution:
    """1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K

    Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest**
    positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n` only contains the
    digit `1`.

    Return *the **length** of* `n`. If there is no such `n`, return -1.

    **Note:** `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer."""
