class Solution:
    """3620. Network Recovery Pathways

    You are given a directed acyclic graph of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n − 1`. This
    is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `m`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi,
    costi]` indicates a one‐way communication from node `ui` to node `vi` with a
    recovery cost of `costi`.

    Some nodes may be offline. You are given a boolean array `online` where `online[i] =
    true` means node `i` is online. Nodes 0 and `n − 1` are always online.

    A path from 0 to `n − 1` is **valid** if:

    * All intermediate nodes on the path are online.

    * The total recovery cost of all edges on the path does not exceed `k`.

    For each valid path, define its **score** as the minimum edge‐cost along that path.

    Return the **maximum** path score (i.e., the largest **minimum**-edge cost) among
    all valid paths. If no valid path exists, return -1."""

    def find_max_path_score(
        self, edges: list[list[int]], online: list[bool], k: int
    ) -> int: ...

    findMaxPathScore = find_max_path_score
