    """3714. Longest Balanced Substring II

    You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and
    `'c'`.

    A **substring** of `s` is called **balanced** if all **distinct** characters in the
    **substring** appear the **same** number of times.

    Return the **length of the longest balanced substring** of `s`."""
