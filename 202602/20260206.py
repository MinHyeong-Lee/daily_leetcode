class Solution:
    """3634. Minimum Removals to Balance Array

    You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

    An array is considered **balanced** if the value of its **maximum** element is **at
    most** `k` times the **minimum** element.

    You may remove **any** number of elements from `nums`\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b without making it
    **empty**.

    Return the **minimum** number of elements to remove so that the remaining array is
    balanced.

    **Note:** An array of size 1 is considered balanced as its maximum and minimum are
    equal, and the condition always holds true."""

    def min_removal(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int: ...
