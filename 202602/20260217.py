class Solution:
    """401. Binary Watch

    A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs on
    the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with
    the least significant bit on the right.

    * For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`.

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/binarywatch.jpg)

    Given an integer `turned_on` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently
    on (ignoring the PM), return *all possible times the watch could represent*. You may
    return the answer in **any order**.

    The hour must not contain a leading zero.

    * For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.

    The minute must consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

    * For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`."""
