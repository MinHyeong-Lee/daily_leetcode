class Solution:
    """3666. Minimum Operations to Equalize Binary String

    You are given a binary string `s`, and an integer `k`.

    In one operation, you must choose **exactly** `k` **different** indices and **flip**
    each `'0'` to `'1'` and each `'1'` to `'0'`.

    Return the **minimum** number of operations required to make all characters in the
    string equal to `'1'`. If it is not possible, return -1."""
